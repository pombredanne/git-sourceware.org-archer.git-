/* Return 0 if the memory mapping (which is related to FILTERFLAGS, V,

   greater than 0 if it should.

   In a nutshell, this is the logic that we follow in order to decide
   if a mapping should be dumped or not.

   - If the mapping is associated to a file whose name ends with
     " (deleted)", or if the file is "/dev/zero", or if it is
     "/SYSV%08x" (shared memory), or if there is no file associated
     with it, or if the AnonHugePages: or the Anonymous: fields in the
     /proc/PID/smaps have contents, then GDB considers this mapping to
     be anonymous.  Otherwise, GDB considers this mapping to be a
     file-backed mapping (because there will be a file associated with
     it).
 
     It is worth mentioning that, from all those checks described
     above, the most fragile is the one to see if the file name ends
     with " (deleted)".  This does not necessarily mean that the
     mapping is anonymous, because the deleted file associated with
     the mapping may have been a hard link to another file, for
     example.  The Linux kernel checks to see if "i_nlink == 0", but
     GDB cannot easily (and normally) do this check (iff running as
     root, it could find the mapping in /proc/PID/map_files/ and
     determine whether there still are other hard links to the
     inode/file).  Therefore, we made a compromise here, and we assume
     that if the file name ends with " (deleted)", then the mapping is
     indeed anonymous.  FWIW, this is something the Linux kernel could
     do better: expose this information in a more direct way.
 
   - If we see the flag "sh" in the "VmFlags:" field (in
     /proc/PID/smaps), then certainly the memory mapping is shared
     (VM_SHARED).  If we have access to the VmFlags, and we don't see
     the "sh" there, then certainly the mapping is private.  However,
     Linux kernels before commit
     834f82e2aa9a8ede94b17b656329f850c1471514 (3.10) do not have the
     "VmFlags:" field; in that case, we use another heuristic: if we
     see 'p' in the permission flags, then we assume that the mapping
     is private, even though the presence of the 's' flag there would
     mean VM_MAYSHARE, which means the mapping could still be private.
     This should work OK enough, however.  */
